# Sales Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the sales of a product or service based on advertising expenditure across various mediums using machine learning techniques in Python. Sales prediction is crucial for businesses to optimize their advertising strategies and maximize sales potential.

Features:

The dataset includes advertising expenditure data for TV, radio, and newspaper mediums, along with corresponding sales figures.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to gain insights into the data distribution and relationships between variables.
Multiple machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and Support Vector Regressor, are trained and evaluated for sales prediction.
Feature importance analysis is conducted to determine the most effective advertising medium for driving sales.

Key Findings:

The Random Forest Regressor model outperformed other models, achieving the lowest Mean Squared Error and highest R-squared.
Feature importance analysis revealed that TV advertising expenditure has the greatest impact on sales, followed by radio advertising, while newspaper advertising has relatively little impact.

Future Improvements:

Explore additional features such as seasonality, competitor advertising, and economic indicators for more accurate sales prediction.
Implement advanced machine learning techniques and ensemble methods for further model improvement.
Develop a web application or dashboard for interactive sales forecasting and visualization.

Tools and Libraries Used:

Python
pandas
NumPy
scikit-learn
Matplotlib
seaborn

Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is named "advertising.csv" and contains advertising expenditure data for TV, radio, and newspaper mediums, along with corresponding sales figures.

Feel free to explore the notebook for detailed analysis and code implementation.
